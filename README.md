This is educational project from course "React: way of Samurai" on YouTube ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).  
It is my first "big" project in React, using a lot of features.  
It will not work, if you have not account in https://social-network.samuraijs.com/  
Also you need added your token ( web key) and id frow samurai.js API
